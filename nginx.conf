# nginx.conf
#
# This is a custom configuration file for Nginx.
# It tells Nginx to listen on port 8080, as required by Google Cloud Vertex AI.

server {
  # Listen on port 8080.
  listen 8080;

  # Set the root directory to where our static files are located.
  root /usr/share/nginx/html;

  # This is a catch-all for single-page applications (SPAs).
  # If a requested file is not found, it serves index.html instead.
  # This allows client-side routing (like React Router) to work correctly.
  location / {
    try_files $uri /index.html;
